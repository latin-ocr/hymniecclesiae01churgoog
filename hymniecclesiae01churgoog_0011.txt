Throne of Grace than a sort of intercourse, first with oneself,
then with one's brethren, then with saints and Angeia, nay, 1

praises of God; and the very nature of praise involves a cer·

speaking to iiim. The Psalms, then, as being praises and
thanksgivings, are the language, the ordinary converse, as it-
may be called, of saints and Ang⁸els in heaven; and, being
such, could not be written except by men who had heard the

they are more difficult than Prayers. Beggars can express their
wants to a prince; they cannot converse iike his courtiers.

kind of Psalms written for particular occasions, chiefly oc-
casions of thanksgiving. Such are the two Songs of Moses,
the Song of Hannah, those in Isaiah, the Soug ot' Henekiah
